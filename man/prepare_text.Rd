  text,
  whitespace = TRUE,
  control_characters = TRUE,
  replacement_characters = TRUE,
  diacritics = TRUE,
  cjk = TRUE,
  punctuation = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{text}{A character vector to clean.}

\item{whitespace}{Logical scalar; squish whitespace characters (using
\code{\link[stringr]{str_squish}})?}

\item{control_characters}{Logical scalar; remove control characters?}

\item{diacritics}{Logical scalar; remove diacritical marks (accents, etc)
from characters?}

\item{cjk}{Logical scalar; add spaces around Chinese/Japanese/Korean
ideographs?}

\item{punctuation}{Logical scalar; add spaces around punctuation (to make it
easier to keep punctuation during tokenization)?}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=space_punctuation]{space_punctuation}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{hyphens}}{Logical; treat hyphens between letters and at the start/end of
words as punctuation? Other hyphens are always treated as punctuation.}
    \item{\code{abbreviations}}{Logical; treat apostrophes between letters as
punctuation? Other apostrophes are always treated as punctuation.}
  }}

\item{remove_replacement_characters}{Logical scalar; remove the "replacement
character", \code{U-FFFD}?}
}
\value{
The character vector, cleaned as specified.
}
\description{
This function combines the other functions in this package to prepare text
for tokenization. The text gets converted to valid UTF-8 (if possible), and
then various cleaning functions are applied.
